// Part4: Deleting Functions
#include<iostream>

// Define printInt function, which accepts an integer and prints it
void printInt(int x) 
{
    std::cout <<  "The integer is: " << x << std::endl;
}

// Define printIntStrict, which does the identical thing
void printIntStrict(int x) 
{
    std::cout <<  "The integer is: " << x << std::endl;
}

// This time, we also define the function for char and boolean, which will overload the function
// But instead of implementing these functions, we assign them to delete
void printIntStrict(char) = delete;
void printIntStrict(bool) = delete;

int main() 
{
    printInt(1); // Works because 1 is an integer
    printInt('c'); // Works because char is automatically converted to int 
    printInt(true); // Works because boolean is automatically converted to int
    
    printIntStrict(1); // Works because 1 is an integer
    // printIntStrict('c'); // ERROR: The function is defined as delete
    // printIntStrict(false); // ERROR: The function is defined as delete
