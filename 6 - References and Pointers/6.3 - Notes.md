> #### Lvalue Reference

An <u><strong style="color:#dab1da">lvalue reference</strong></u> is an alias for an existing object, declared using `&`. It creates another name for the same object in memory.

```cpp
int x { 5 };
int& ref { x };   // ref is now an alias for x
ref = 10;         // Changes x to 10
std::cout << x;   // Prints 10
```

Once initialized, the reference and the original variable refer to the same memory location. Modifying one affects the other.

> #### Lvalue Reference to Const

An <u><strong style="color:#dab1da">lvalue reference to const</strong></u> treats the referenced object as a **read-only** variable. The object itself doesn't need to be const, but it cannot be modified through the const reference.

```cpp
int x { 5 };
const int& cref { x };     // Constant reference to non-const variable
std::cout << cref;         // Can read: prints 5
// cref = 10;              // Error: cannot modify through const reference
x = 10;                    // Valid: can still modify x directly
std::cout << cref;         // Prints 10 (cref reflects the change)
```

**References must follow these rules:**

- Must be initialized at declaration
- Cannot be reseated (changed to refer to another object)
- No null references (always refer to valid objects)
- Automatically dereference (cleaner syntax than pointers)
- Safer than pointers (no pointer arithmetic, always valid)

```cpp
int x { 5 };
int y { 10 };
int& ref { x };    // Must initialize
// int& ref2;      // Error: must be initialized
ref = y;           // Does NOT reseat; assigns y's value to x
// ref = &y;       // Error: wrong type
```

|Feature|References|Pointers|
|---|---|---|
|Initialization|Required|Optional (dangerous if not)|
|Null value|No|Yes (`nullptr`)|
|Reseating|No|Yes|
|Syntax|Automatic|Explicit (`*` to dereference)|
|Safety|Safer|More error-prone|
|Flexibility|Limited|More flexible|

**Use references when:** You need an alias and won't need to change what you're referring to **Use pointers when:** You need null values, reseating, or pointer arithmetic
