## 1. Task Overview

Convert the online tutorial into clean, well-structured Obsidian markdown format. You have full creative freedom to:
- Reorganize unclear structures
- Create logical sections
- Improve clarity while keeping content concise for review purposes

## 2. Obsidian Formatting Requirements

### 2.1 Outline & Callout Usage

The document should have an h1 title, and should be divided into a few sections, each beginning with a callout with a h2 sub-title. Below each section, there should be some content, sometimes further divided by h4 titles.

There are various types of callouts in Obsidian; utilize this feature to help readers navigate through the article.

**Callout Types:**
- `[!abstract]` - Introduction
- `[!quote]` - Concept
- `[!fact]` - Important Information
- `[!info]` - Additional Information
- `[!warning]` Warning
- `[!hint]` - Best Practice
- `[!example]` - Examples

```markdown
# 7. References and Pointers

> [!quote] Concept
> ## Appropriate Subtitle

Introduce new terminology or key concepts.

> [!fact] Important
> ## Appropriate Subtitle

Writes about important information that is required to know.

> [!info] Additional
> ## Appropriate Subtitle

Writes about related information that is good know but not required.

> [!hint] Best Pratice
> ## Appropriate Subtitle

Post a best practice or regulate the code style. 

> [!example] Example
> #### Appropriate Subtitle

To provide an example.

> [!warning] Warning
> #### Appropriate Subtitle
> To avoid something. Warning is the only callout where the content is contained in the callout
```

**IMPORTANT** only use callout for title, no callout for the content following it. (export for warning).

### 2.2 Multi-Column Layouts

**AVOID** multi-column layouts in Obsidian. Use sequential structure with clear headings instead.

### 2.3 Graphs and Figures

For hand-drawn graphs:

```markdown
[Insert graph: description of what should be shown]
```

### 2.4 Important Terminology

Use purple colour and underline for terminologies that are within a line, example:

```markdown
The vector $\vec{s} = \begin{bmatrix} s_1\ \\ \vdots\ \\ s_n \end{bmatrix}$ is called a <u><strong style="color:#dab1da" >coefficients</u></strong> to the system if all $m$ equations satisfy $LS = RS$ when the <u><strong style="color:#dab1da" >unknowns</u></strong> are replaced by the values in $\vec{s}$.

The <u><strong style="color:#dab1da" >solution set</u></strong> is the set that contains all possible solutions to the system.
```

Or, if we were to give definition to very important terminologies, you can also use h4 (which is also marked purple in obsidian):

```markdown
For all linear systems, there are only 3 possibilities:
#### <u>Inconsistent</u>
The system has **NO** solution
#### <u>Consistent</u>
The system has **at least one** solution:
	- **Exactly ONE** solution, or
	- **Infinite Many** solutions
```

## 3. Content Guidelines

You will be given the content of a few documents, each of length 4-5 pages as plain text at a time, convert them into one document of about 2 page size. This means that you need to shrink the content to about 1/4 the original size. Discard introduction part, unusual examples, outdated language features and only keep the best practices.

If you are given a desired outline, just follow that structure. Otherwise, provide a few structures with different structuring logic to choose from, and ask for the user to select one. 

### 3.1 What to Fix

- Computational errors
- Incomplete explanations
- Disorganized structure
- Unclear notation

### 3.2 Organization Tips

- Group related concepts
- Break complex theorems into parts
- Add "why" explanations between steps
- Use consistent terminology

In this chapter, we’ll take a first look at a number of topics that are essential to every C++ program. Because there are quite a few topics to cover, we’ll cover most at a fairly shallow level (just enough to get by). The goal of this chapter is to help you understand how basic C++ programs are constructed. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to write your own simple programs. In future chapters, we’ll revisit the majority of these topics and explore them in more detail. We’ll also introduce new concepts that build on top of these. In order to keep the lesson lengths manageable, topics may be split over several subsequent lessons. If you feel like some important concept isn’t covered in a lesson, or you have a question that isn’t answered in the current lesson, it’s possible that it’s covered in the next lesson. Statements A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action. Ezoic Statements are by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program. This is because they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language. When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in sentences (not in random words or syllables). In C++, when we want to have our program do something, we typically write statements. Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, it’s probably a statement. In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language instructions. For advanced readers There are many different kinds of statements in C++: Declaration statements Jump statements Expression statements Compound statements Selection statements (conditionals) Iteration statements (loops) Try blocks By the time you’re through with this tutorial series, you’ll understand what all of these are! Functions and the main function In C++, statements are typically grouped into units called functions. A function is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom). As you learn to write your own programs, you’ll be able to create your own functions and mix and match statements in any way you please (we’ll show how in a future lesson). Ezoic Rule Every C++ program must have a special function named main (all lower case letters). When the program is run, the statements inside of main are executed in sequential order. Programs typically terminate (finish running) after the last statement inside function main has been executed (though programs may abort early in some circumstances, or do some cleanup afterwards). Functions are typically written to do a specific job or perform some useful action. For example, a function named max might contain statements that figures out which of two numbers is larger. A function named calculateGrade might calculate a student’s grade from a set of test scores. A function named printEmployee might print an employee’s information to the console. We will talk a lot more about functions soon, as they are the most commonly used organizing tool in a program. Nomenclature When discussing functions, it’s fairly common shorthand to append a pair of parenthesis to the end of the function’s name. For example, if you see the term main() or doSomething(), this is shorthand for functions named main or doSomething respectively. This helps differentiate functions from other things with names (such as variables) without having to write the word “function” each time. In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc…) is called its identifier. Characters and text The earliest computers were designed primarily for mathematical calculations and data processing. As hardware improved, networking became accessible, and consumer software evolved, computers also became valuable tools for written communication. Ezoic In written language, the most basic unit of communication is the character. To simplify slightly, a character is a written symbol or mark, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or mathematical symbol. When we tap an alphabetic or numeric key on our keyboard, a character is produced as a result, which can then be displayed on the screen. The following are all characters: a, 2, $, and =. In many cases, such as when writing words or sentences, we want to make use of more than one character. A sequence of characters is called text (also called a string in programming contexts). Nomenclature Conventionally, the term “text” is also used to mean plain text, which is text that contains only characters that appear on a standard keyboard, with no special formatting or styling. For example, plain text cannot represent bold words, as that requires styling. Our C++ programs are written as plain text. For advanced readers Computers have an additional type of character, called a “control character”. These are characters that have special meaning to the computer system, but either aren’t intended to be displayed, or display as something other than a single visible symbol. Examples of well-known control characters include “escape” (which doesn’t display anything), “tab” (which displays as some number of spaces), and “backspace” (which erases the previous character). Related content We discuss the outputting of characters and text in lesson 1.5 -- Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl. We discuss characters (including control characters) in more detail in lesson 4.11 -- Chars. Dissecting Hello world! Now that you have a brief understanding of what statements and functions are, let’s return to our “Hello world” program and take a high-level look at what each line does in more detail. #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << "Hello world!"; return 0; } Line 1 is a special type of line called a preprocessor directive. This #include preprocessor directive indicates that we would like to use the contents of the iostream library, which is the part of the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the console. We need this line in order to use std::cout on line 5. Excluding this line would result in a compile error on line 5, as the compiler wouldn’t otherwise know what std::cout is. Line 2 is blank, and is ignored by the compiler. This line exists only to help make the program more readable to humans (by separating the #include preprocessor directive and the subsequent parts of the program). Ezoic Line 3 tells the compiler that we’re going to write (define) a function whose name (identifier) is main. As you learned above, every C++ program must have a main function or it will fail to link. This function will produce a value whose type is int (an integer). Lines 4 and 7 tell the compiler which lines are part of the main function. Everything between the opening curly brace on line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the main function. This is called the function body. Line 5 is the first statement within function main, and is the first statement that will execute when we run our program. std::cout (which stands for “character output”) and the << operator allow us to display information on the console. In this case, we’re displaying the text Hello world!. This statement creates the visible output of the program. Line 6 is a return statement. When an executable program finishes running, the program sends a value back to the operating system in order to indicate whether it ran successfully or not. This particular return statement returns the integer value 0 to the operating system, which means “everything went okay!”. This is the last statement in the program that executes. All of the programs we write will follow this general template, or a variation on it. Ezoic Author’s note If parts (or all) of the above explanation are confusing, that’s to be expected at this point. This was just to provide a quick overview. Subsequent lessons will dig into all of the above topics, with plenty of additional explanation and examples. You can compile and run this program yourself, and you will see that it outputs the following to the console: Hello world! If you run into issues compiling or executing this program, check out lesson 0.8 -- A few common C++ problems. Syntax and syntax errors In the English language, sentences are constructed according to specific grammatical rules that you probably learned in English class in school. For example, in writing, normal sentences end in a period. The set of rules that describe how specific words (and punctuation) can be arranged to form valid sentences in a language is called syntax. For example, “My house painted is blue” is a syntax error, because the ordering of the words is unconventional. “All your base are belong to us!” is another notable one. The C++ programming language also has a syntax, which describes how the elements of your program must be written and arranged in order for the program to be considered valid. When you compile your program, the compiler is responsible for making sure your program follows these syntactical rules. If your program does something that deviates from the syntax of the language, the compiler will halt compilation and issue a _syntax error. Unlike the English language, which allows for a lot of ambiguity, the syntax rules of C++ are strictly defined and upheld. Syntax errors are common. Fortunately, such errors are typically straightforward to find and fix, as the compiler will generally point you right at them. Compilation of a program will only complete once all syntax errors are resolved. Ezoic Since the syntax for most statements requires those statements to end in a semicolon, let’s see what happens if we omit the semicolon on line 5 of the “Hello world” program, like this: #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << "Hello world!" return 0; } Feel free to compile this ill-formed program yourself. When compiled using Clang, the following error message is generated: prog.cc:5:31: error: expected ';' after expression Clang is telling us that on line 5 at the 31st character, the syntax rules require a semicolon, but we did not provide one. Therefore, compilation was halted with an error. When compiled with Visual Studio instead, the compiler produces this compilation error: Ezoic c:\vcprojects\hello.cpp(6): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'return' x video of: First C++ Program | How to program in C++Play Video Now Playing x video of: First C++ Program | How to program in C++Play Video First C++ Program | How to program in C++ Watch on Video channel logo First C++ Program | How to program in C++ Note that Visual Studio says the error was encountered on line 6 (instead of on line 5). So who is right? Both are, in a way. Clang knows we conventionally put semicolons at the end of statements, so it is reporting that the error is on line 5 based on the assumption that we will do so. Visual Studio is opting to report the line it was compiling when it determined that the error occurred (on line 6, when it encountered return instead of the expected semicolon). Key insight Compilers will sometimes report that an error has occurred on the line after the one where we’d conventionally fix the issue. If you can’t find the error on the line indicated, check the prior line. To see other different error messages, experiment with deleting characters or even whole lines from the “Hello world” program. Also try restoring the missing semicolon at the end of line 5, and then deleting lines 1, 3, or 4 to see what happens.

Learn C++ Learn C++ Skill up with our free tutorials Skip to content Navigate Site Index Latest Changes About Search 1.2 — Comments 1.2 — Comments Alex March 19, 2025 A comment is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are for the programmer’s use only. In C++ there are two different styles of comments, both of which serve the same purpose: to help programmers document the code in some way. Single-line comments The // symbol begins a C++ single-line comment, which tells the compiler to ignore everything from the // symbol to the end of the line. For example: x Play Unmute Fullscreen Now Playing x video of: C++ Tutorial - How to Get User Input in C++Play Video C++ Tutorial - How to Get User Input in C++ Watch on Video channel logo C++ Tutorial - How to Get User Input in C++ std::cout << "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to the end of the line is ignored Typically, the single-line comment is used to make a quick comment about a single line of code. std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // std::cout lives in the iostream library std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // these comments make the code hard to read std::cout << "Yeah!\n"; // especially when lines are different lengths Having comments to the right of a line can make both the code and the comment hard to read, particularly if the line is long. If the lines are fairly short, the comments can simply be aligned (usually to a tab stop), like so: Ezoic std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // std::cout lives in the iostream library std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // this is much easier to read std::cout << "Yeah!\n"; // don't you think so? However, if the lines are long, placing comments to the right can make your lines really long. In that case, single-line comments are often placed above the line it is commenting: // std::cout lives in the iostream library std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // this is much easier to read std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // don't you think so? std::cout << "Yeah!\n"; Author’s note In this tutorial series, our examples fall into one of the following categories: Full programs (those with a main() function). These are ready to be compiled and run. Snippets (small pieces) of code, such as the statements above. We use these to demonstrate specific concepts in a concise manner. We don’t intend for you to compile snippets. But if you’d like to, you’ll need to turn them into a full program. Typically, that program will look something like this: #include <iostream> int main() { // Replace this line with the snippet(s) of code you'd like to compile return 0; } Multi-line comments The /* and */ pair of symbols denotes a C-style multi-line comment. Everything in between the symbols is ignored. /* This is a multi-line comment. This line will be ignored. So will this one. */ Since everything between the symbols is ignored, you will sometimes see programmers “beautify” their multi-line comments: /* This is a multi-line comment. * the matching asterisks to the left * can make this easier to read */ Multi-line style comments can not be nested. Consequently, the following will have unexpected results: /* This is a multi-line /* comment */ this is not inside the comment */ // The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */ When the compiler tries to compile this, it will ignore everything from the first /* to the first */. Since this is not inside the comment */ is not considered part of the comment, the compiler will try to compile it. That will inevitably result in a compile error. Ezoic This is one place where using a syntax highlighter can be really useful, as the different coloring for comment should make clear what’s considered part of the comment vs not. Warning Don’t use multi-line comments inside other multi-line comments. Wrapping single-line comments inside a multi-line comment is okay. Proper use of comments Typically, comments should be used for three things. First, for a given library, program, or function, comments are best used to describe what the library, program, or function, does. These are typically placed at the top of the file or library, or immediately preceding the function. For example: // This program calculates the student's final grade based on their test and homework scores. // This function uses Newton's method to approximate the root of a given equation. // The following lines generate a random item based on rarity, level, and a weight factor. All of these comments give the reader a good idea of what the library, program, or function is trying to accomplish without having to look at the actual code. The user (possibly someone else, or you if you’re trying to reuse code you’ve previously written) can tell at a glance whether the code is relevant to what he or she is trying to accomplish. This is particularly important when working as part of a team, where not everybody will be familiar with all of the code. Second, within a library, program, or function described above, comments can be used to describe how the code is going to accomplish its goal. /* To calculate the final grade, we sum all the weighted midterm and homework scores and then divide by the number of scores to assign a percentage, which is used to calculate a letter grade. */ // To generate a random item, we're going to do the following: // 1) Put all of the items of the desired rarity on a list // 2) Calculate a probability for each item based on level and weight factor // 3) Choose a random number // 4) Figure out which item that random number corresponds to // 5) Return the appropriate item These comments give the user an idea of how the code is going to accomplish its goal without having to understand what each individual line of code does. Ezoic Third, at the statement level, comments should be used to describe why the code is doing something. A bad statement comment explains what the code is doing. If you ever write code that is so complex that needs a comment to explain what a statement is doing, you probably need to rewrite your statement, not comment it. Here are some examples of bad line comments and good statement comments. Bad comment: // Set sight range to 0 sight = 0; Reason: We already can see that sight is being set to 0 by looking at the statement Good comment: // The player just drank a potion of blindness and can not see anything sight = 0; Reason: Now we know why the player’s sight is being set to 0 Bad comment: // Calculate the cost of the items cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice; Reason: We can see that this is a cost calculation, but why is quantity multiplied by 2? Ezoic Good comment: // We need to multiply quantity by 2 here because they are bought in pairs cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice; Reason: Now we know why this formula makes sense. Programmers often have to make a tough decision between solving a problem one way, or solving it another way. Comments are a great way to remind yourself (or tell somebody else) the reason you made one decision instead of another. Good comments: // We decided to use a linked list instead of an array because // arrays do insertion too slowly. // We're going to use Newton's method to find the root of a number because // there is no deterministic way to solve these equations. Finally, comments should be written in a way that makes sense to someone who has no idea what the code does. It is often the case that a programmer will say “It’s obvious what this does! There’s no way I’ll forget about this”. Guess what? It’s not obvious, and you will be amazed how quickly you forget. :) You (or someone else) will thank you later for writing down the what, how, and why of your code in human language. Reading individual lines of code is easy. Understanding what goal they are meant to accomplish is not. Related content We discuss commenting for variable declaration statements in lesson 1.7 -- Keywords and naming identifiers. Best practice Comment your code liberally, and write your comments as if speaking to someone who has no idea what the code does. Don’t assume you’ll remember why you made specific choices. Author’s note Throughout the rest of this tutorial series, we’ll use comments inside code blocks to draw your attention to specific things, or help illustrate how things work (while ensuring the programs still compile). Astute readers will note that by the above standards, most of these comments are horrible. :) As you read through the rest of the tutorials, keep in mind that the comments are serving an intentional educational purpose, not trying to demonstrate what good comments look like. As an aside… Documentation generation programs such as Doxygen are designed to help generate and leverage documentation in various ways. Amongst other things, they can: Help standardize the way your code is documented. Generate diagrams, visualizations, and cross-links to make understanding the code structure easier. Export your documentation to other formats (e.g. HTML) so it can be easily shared with others (e.g. other team members, or developers who are integrating whatever you are writing). You won’t need these while learning the language, but you may encounter them or find them useful in the future, especially in professional environments. Commenting out code Converting one or more lines of code into a comment is called commenting out your code. This provides a convenient way to (temporarily) exclude parts of your code from being included in your compiled program. To comment out a single line of code, simply use the // style comment to turn a line of code into a comment temporarily: Ezoic Uncommented out: std::cout << 1; Commented out: // std::cout << 1; To comment out a block of code, use // on multiple lines of code, or the /* */ style comment to turn the block of code into a comment temporarily. Uncommented out: std::cout << 1; std::cout << 2; std::cout << 3; Commented out: // std::cout << 1; // std::cout << 2; // std::cout << 3; or /* std::cout << 1; std::cout << 2; std::cout << 3; */ There are quite a few reasons you might want to do this: You’re working on a new piece of code that won’t compile yet, and you need to run the program. The compiler won’t let you compile the code if there are compiler errors. Commenting out the code that won’t compile will allow the program to compile so you can run it. When you’re ready, you can uncomment the code, and continue working on it. You’ve written new code that compiles but doesn’t work correctly, and you don’t have time to fix it until later. Commenting out the broken code will ensure the broken code doesn’t execute and cause problems until you can fix it. To find the source of an error. If a program isn’t producing the desired results (or is crashing), it can sometimes be useful to disable parts of your code to see if you can isolate what’s causing it to not work correctly. If you comment out one or more lines of code, and your program starts working as expected (or stops crashing), odds are whatever you last commented out was part of the problem. You can then investigate why those lines of code are causing the problem. You want to replace one piece of code with another piece of code. Instead of just deleting the original code, you can comment it out and leave it there for reference until you’re sure your new code works properly. Once you are sure your new code is working, you can remove the old commented out code. If you can’t get your new code to work, you can always delete the new code and uncomment the old code to revert to what you had before. Commenting out code is a common thing to do while developing, so many IDEs provide support for commenting out a highlighted section of code. How you access this functionality varies by IDE. For Visual Studio users You can comment or uncomment a selection via Edit menu > Advanced > Comment Selection (or Uncomment Selection). For Code::Blocks users You can comment or uncomment a selection via Edit menu > Comment (or Uncomment, or Toggle comment, or any of the other comment tools). For VS Code users You can comment or uncomment a selection by pressing ctrl-/. Tip If you always use single line comments for your normal comments, then you can always use multi-line comments to comment out your code without conflict. If you use multi-line comments to document your code, then commenting-out code using comments can become more challenging. If you do need to comment out a code block that contains multi-line comments, you can also consider using the #if 0 preprocessor directive, which we discuss in lesson 2.10 -- Introduction to the preprocessor. Summary At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe what. Inside the library, program, or function, use comments to describe how. At the statement level, use comments to describe why.

- Introduction to C++ Programs
- Core Components (statements, functions, main)
- Code Documentation (comments)
- Best Practices

**Option 2: Hierarchical Learning Path**

- Program Structure Fundamentals
- Writing Valid C++ Code
- Code Documentation Practices

**Option 3: Practical Focus**

- Building Your First Program
- Understanding Program Flow
- Documenting Your Code

Which structure would you prefer? Or would you like me to suggest a different organization based on your learning goals?

Also, please confirm:

1. Should I merge both documents (1.1 and 1.2) into a single note?
2. Are there any specific sections you want emphasized or de-emphasized?
3. Do you want code examples included (they take up space)?
```

Input2: (Choose option1, and gave some instructions to improve)

Output2: (well-organized note dropping some of the unimportant stuff)

> ## Statements & Functions
#### <u>Statement</u>
The smallest independent unit of computation that causes the program to perform an action. Most statements end with a semicolon (`;`).

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";  // This is a statement
return 0;                      // This is also a statement
```

#### <u>Function</u>
A collection of statements executed sequentially.
```cpp
int function(int a)
{
	// do something
	return 0;
}
```

> ## The main() Function

Every C++ program **must** have a function named `main` (lowercase). When the program runs, statements inside `main` execute sequentially from top to bottom. The program terminates after the last statement in `main` executes.
```cpp
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!";
    return 0;
}
```


> [!example] Example
> 
> ## "Hello World"

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```

#### Line-by-Line Breakdown
- `#include <iostream>` - <u><strong style="color:#dab1da">Preprocessor directive</strong></u> that includes the iostream library for console I/O
- `int main()` - Declares the main function that returns an integer
- `{` and `}` - Define the <u><strong style="color:#dab1da">function body</strong></u>
- `std::cout << "Hello world!";` - Outputs text to console
- `return 0;` - Returns 0 to the OS indicating successful execution


> [!fact] Important
> 
> ## Syntax Errors
> 

A <u><strong style="color:#dab1da">syntax error</strong></u> occurs when code violates C++ grammar rules. The compiler will halt and point to the error location. Missing semicolons are the most common syntax errors.

**Key Insight**: If the compiler reports an error on a line but you can't find it, check the **previous line** - the error may actually be there.

> ## Documenting Your Code
#### <u>Single-Line Comments</u>
Use `//` to comment from the symbol to the end of the line.

```cpp
// This entire line is a comment
std::cout << "Hello!";  // Comment after code
```

#### <u>Multi-Line Comments</u>
Use `/* */` to comment multiple lines.

```cpp
/* This comment spans
   multiple lines */
```

> [!warning] Warning
> 
> **Never nest multi-line comments** - they cannot be nested inside each other. However, wrapping single-line comments inside multi-line comments is acceptable.

Use comments for three purposes:

**1. What**: Describe what the library/program/function does (at the top)
```cpp
// This program calculates student's final grade based on test scores
```

**2. How**: Describe the approach or algorithm
```cpp
// To generate random items:
// 1) List all items of desired rarity
// 2) Calculate probability for each item
// 3) Choose random number and map to item
```

**3. Why**: Explain reasoning behind decisions at the statement level
```cpp
// Player drank blindness potion and cannot see
sight = 0;

// Multiply by 2 because items are bought in pairs
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```
